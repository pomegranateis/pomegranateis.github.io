## What I did
For our second flipped class today, we were given the work to make our own ER Models! After our class on thorough lesson about database design process and relational data models we were actually looking forward to working in groups again. 

So basically, there were about six groups and each individual was provided a home group to do the chart-paper work. It was actually very nostalgic using chartpapers for our presentation since it brought so many forgotten high school/middle school memories. We could come up with any ER models we wanted or we could make for one which might possibly already exist, giving us a choice which was better. 

After some time, groups picked representatives to come up at front and explain their models to the class. Our tutor asked questions with no differentiation so each one of us was included. So many fun moments and laughters were shared and the presenters did such amazing jobs. 

It was a really nice session.

## What I learned
Our group got to do an ER model for a Student Information Management System. We could do any but we chose to make an ideal but a possible ER model which was mostly inspired by the VLE and IMS ER models.

Discussing made me realise how important and distinctive the components of an ERD were. How each entity needed its own descriptive attributes and needed relations to describe those attributes.

I bummed myself and lost concentration midway honestly and could not understand any of the relation lines(cardinalities) to use for different cases like one to many or vice versa. But as I was discussing with my team members and also while listening to my friends present helped me understand what I missed earlier.

When we got to present, our tutor pointed out how we made a mistake and failed to represent a 'weak entity' correctly. It shan't be acceptable but she made us learn our mistake and it was very helpful. I do not wish to be careless ever again. 

Many more lessons I learned included describing attributes by correct and sensable relations. It put me to mind how the inside of a system of a database ran.

## How can the Flipped Class be Improved
Flipped class can be more fun if we get to interact in a different team next time as I feel like I keep on meeting the same person over and over again.(Only two flipped classes until now but still)
I am aware our tutor will most probably do the shuffling but I could only find this flaw and I needed something to point out. x

ciao.
