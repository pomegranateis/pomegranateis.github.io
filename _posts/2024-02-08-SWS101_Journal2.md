# HackTheBox Tier 0 and 1 Walkthrough

---

## Tier 0

In this Tier, there are absolute fundamentals of attacking a Machine. We learn how to connect to the VPN, perform basic enumeration of ports and services, and interact with the services you find. Each Machine in this Tier is focused on a particular tool or service and contains only a single primary step.

 
### Meow

There are some few questions we get to anwer before moving onto our main task that is finding the root flag using telnet.

These questions are easy and understandable and the answers can be found simply by googling.

To find the root flag, I started off with an nmap scanning which gives us a result of telnet port 23/tcp being open.

I sign in on telnet using "root" and find out there's no need of a password. After this, i list the files and read out the flag.txt to view root flag.

### Fawn

Same as meow, questions can be answered by googling. 

To submit flag, firstly i scan my IP and find ftp port 21/tcp open.

When connecting to the target i can login as an anonymous user and have either no password or just a random password, i get logged in successfully.

Once connected, i list out files in the currnet directory and i find the flag and i use the command “get” to download the file to our machine.

Then reading out the flag i have the answer to the last task for Fawn.

### Dancing

After scanning the target i find it has 3 open ports;139, 445, 135.

After some research on SMB, I came across an article about connecting to a SMB share with anonymous login. So I tested it and it gave me a result of what is available on the target.

Seeing what I can actually connect to, I noted I could not connect to “ADMIN$”, “C$” and “IPC$”. But I successfully connect to “WorkShares”.

After connecting successfully to the WorkShares, I listed out the files in the current directory and discovered two direcories.

After some digging, in the “James.P” directory I came across the flag and downloaded the file using the “get”.

Reading out the file I get the answer for the last task.

### Redeemer

After scanning the target i find put all tcp ports are closed. So i scan again but with specifying the port. It shows "discovered 6379/tcp open port" whuch is redis, which allows us to have keys and values.

I get inside redis.

GET flag.

## Tier 1

Moving to the next Tier, things are kicked up a notch and a bit more complexity is introduced. Whereas Tier 0's primary focus is demonstrating how to connect to various services, Tier 1 focuses on fundamental exploitation techniques. While the depth of the material in this Tier is increased over the previous, these Machines still feature a single primary exploitation step.


### Appointment

After scanning, i see Port 80 is open which runs the HTTP service. Navigating to the web page in the browser shows up a login page.

![Alt text](<../assets/img/sws/Screenshot from 2024-03-18 01-12-12.png>)

Submit root flag.

### Sequel

I try to access the target machine as root.

![Alt text](<../assets/img/sws/Screenshot from 2024-03-18 01-20-57.png>)

So i can see the databases lists using show databases command.

![Alt text](<../assets/img/sws/Screenshot from 2024-03-18 01-23-50.png>)

We can choose the databases using use <databasename>, see tables using show tables command and also data from config/users using SELECT * command.

![Alt text](<../assets/img/sws/Screenshot from 2024-03-18 01-32-42.png>)

Get flag from config table.

### Crocodile

We can try to connect to Ftp using ftp <ip target> command, we can login using username:anonymous

![Alt text](<../assets/img/sws/Screenshot from 2024-03-18 01-47-25.png>)

To see list content using ls command

![Alt text](<../assets/img/sws/Screenshot from 2024-03-18 01-47-06.png>)

We can download file allowed.userlist and allowed.userlist.passwd using get command

![Alt text](<../assets/img/sws/Screenshot from 2024-03-18 01-46-47.png>)

We can download file allowed.userlist and allowed.userlist.passwd using get command using ffuf to scan directory

### Responder

#### Task 1
When visiting the web service using the IP address, what is the domain that we are being redirected to?

unika.htb

#### Task 2
Which scripting language is being used on the server to generate webpages?

(by running nmap scan)
PHP

#### Task 3

What is the name of the URL parameter which is used to load different language versions of the webpage?

page 

#### Task 4
Which of the following values for the `page` parameter would be an example of exploiting a Local File Include (LFI) vulnerability: “french.html”, “//10.10.14.6/somefile”, “../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts”, “minikatz.exe”

../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts

#### Tasl 5
Which of the following values for the `page` parameter would be an example of exploiting a Remote File Include (RFI) vulnerability: “french.html”, “//10.10.14.6/somefile”, “../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts”, “minikatz.exe”
