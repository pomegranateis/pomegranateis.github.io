# TryHackMe OWASP TOP 10 - 2021

---

## Task 1 [Introduction]

Task 1 is only an introduction to the top most critical web security vulnerabilities which we can exploit.

It is beginner-friendly.

## Task 2 [Accessing Machines]

***Connect to our network or deploy the AttackBox.***

Let's connect to our network using **openvpn**

## Task 3 [1. Broken Access Control]

***Read and understand what broken access control is.***

Broken Access Control occurs when an application does not properly enforce **access** controls, allowing unauthorized users to access resources or perform actions that they should not be able to. 

This leads to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even execution of arbitrary code. 

## Task 4 [Broken Access Control (IDOR Challenge)]

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occurs when an application exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key. 

For example, let's say we're logging into our bank account, and after correctly authenticating ourselves, we get taken to a URL like this https://bank.thm/account?id=123456. On that page, we can see all our important bank details, and a user would do whatever they need to do and move along their way, thinking nothing is wrong.

There is, however, a potentially huge problem here, anyone may be able to change the id parameter to something else like 654321, and if the site is incorrectly configured, then he would have access to someone else's bank information.

### How IDOR works

This vulnerability arises due to a misconfiguration in how user input is handled, allowing attackers to access resources they wouldn't ordinarily be able to access.

IDOR impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization's data.

**Confidentiality** is compromised when an attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive information. **Integrity** can be affected if an attacker modifies data, such as changing passwords or adding unauthorized data. **Availability** can be impacted if an attacker deletes resources they don't have access to.

#### IDOR Attacks

](../assets/img/tryhackme_screenshots/IDOR.png)

1. URL Tampering (changing the value of a parameter in the URL)

2. Body Manipulation (URL tampering, but the attacker modifies values in the body of the document)

3. Cookie or JSON ID Manipulation (change values stored in cookies or JSON objects)

4. Path Traversal (access or manipulate files or folders directly on the server)

**IDOR** can be easily prevented with proper acces control, using indirect object refernces or hashing, and GUIDs.

##### Let us deploy the machine 

**Login details**

username: ***noot***

password: ***test1234***

![alt text](<../assets/img/tryhackme_screenshots/Screenshot from 2024-03-28 16-24-03.png>)

The URL contains ?note_id=1 — I wonder what happens if you change the parameter value? I might be able to access another user’s notes.

Just as expected, with **id=0** I retrieve the flag.

## Task 5 [2. Cryptographic Failures]

Cryptographic Failures are a significant security concern that can lead to data breaches, identity theft, and other serious problems. 

Also called as **sensitive data exposure**. These include use of hard-coded passwords and outdated encryption algorithms or insufficient entropy.

To prevent this, it is best to encrypt sensitive data using TLS or HSTS or a strong cryptographically keyor authenticated encryption. Better to avoid ftp/smtp.
