# TryHackMe OWASP TOP 10 - 2021

---

## Task 1 [Introduction]

Task 1 is only an introduction to the top most critical web security vulnerabilities which we can exploit.

It is beginner-friendly.

## Task 2 [Accessing Machines]

***Connect to our network or deploy the AttackBox.***

Let's connect to our network using **openvpn**

## Task 3 [Broken Access Control]

***Read and understand what broken access control is.***

Broken Access Control occurs when an application does not properly enforce **access** controls, allowing unauthorized users to access resources or perform actions that they should not be able to. 

This leads to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even execution of arbitrary code. 

## Task 4 [Broken Access Control (IDOR Challenge)]

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occurs when an application exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key. 

For example, let's say we're logging into our bank account, and after correctly authenticating ourselves, we get taken to a URL like this https://bank.thm/account?id=123456. On that page, we can see all our important bank details, and a user would do whatever they need to do and move along their way, thinking nothing is wrong.

There is, however, a potentially huge problem here, anyone may be able to change the id parameter to something else like 654321, and if the site is incorrectly configured, then he would have access to someone else's bank information.
