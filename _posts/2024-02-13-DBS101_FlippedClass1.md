### Topic : Datebase Users and Database Administrators

---

For our first flipped class today, we were divided into groups for discussing about database users and administrators. More specifically, it was about different type of database users and database administrator(DBA) which we find out later on that it is also basically a type of a database user.
Our group got assigned to research on DBA so we referred notes provided in vle side by side with the help of search engines as well.
