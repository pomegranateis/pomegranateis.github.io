# Topic : Networking Essentials

---

As a student currently opting for CyberSecurity major, it is essential for me to research and educate myself a foundation for understanding cybersecurity principles, networking fundamentals, and Linux endpoint management, all of which are critical for building secure and resilient IT infrastructures.

## What is Cybersecurity for
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. As learners under this major, I shall encompass variuos strategies aimed at safeguarding information and preventing unauthorized access and data breaches.

This is for warmup to readers who deserve some introduction before you read my journal.

## Before
I had no absolute idea on how the internet actually worked or did not really care about a computer's frontend and backend. 

I did not know what an IP address was, what were protocols or how the network managed its security and its flexible authorization. 

There was so much to learn!

## After
How I took upon was

Networking is like the roads and highways that connect different places. Just as roads allow cars to travel from one city to another, computer networks enable data to move between devices like computers, smartphones, and servers.

For example, imagine you want to send a letter to a friend who lives in another city. You put the letter in an envelope, write the address on it, and send it through the postal system. Similarly, in networking, data is packaged into small units called packets, addressed, and sent over the network to reach its destination.

Whereas the internet is like a vast network of roads, connecting cities and towns all around the world. It's a global network of networks that allows billions of devices to communicate with each other.

For instance, think of the Internet as a massive library where you can access information on almost any topic. When you want to find information, you connect to the Internet through a device like a computer or smartphone, just like entering the library. Then, you use a web browser or other applications to search for and retrieve the information you need.

## Wifi and Hotspot
Lets imagine.

Wi-Fi is like a magic invisible rope that connects your devices to the internet without any physical wires.

Let's say you have a special friend (let's call them the "Wi-Fi magician") who can send messages to your phone, tablet, or computer without using any cables. This friend creates an invisible network around your house or a cafe that your devices can connect to.

So, when you want to use the internet on your phone or laptop, you look for this invisible network, and once you find it, you can connect to it and start browsing, just like magic!

But, a Hotspot is like a mini Wi-Fi zone created by your phone or another device that has internet access.

Imagine you're out with your friends, and no one has internet on their devices except you. Your phone can be like a little Wi-Fi tower that you turn on to share your internet connection with your friends. When you do this, your phone becomes a hotspot.

Your friends can connect to your phone's hotspot, and they'll be able to use the internet on their devices, just as if they were connected to Wi-Fi at home or in a cafe.


## Public Network

A public network refers to a network infrastructure that is accessible to the general public or a wide range of users. These networks are typically designed to provide connectivity in shared spaces such as cafes, airports, libraries, and public parks.

## Private Network

A private network, on the other hand, refers to a network infrastructure that is restricted to authorized users or devices. These networks are commonly found in homes, businesses, educational institutions, and government organizations.

## New
For beginners like me, you will find it quite confusing learning the technical terminologies like IP addresses, DNS, routing, encryption malware. Also the protocols that nver seems to end in category are really hard to differentiate and remember.

To overcome these challenges, we should build our foundation strong and always research and research and research. Breaking down complex topics into smaller chunks was very helpful in my case. It was less confusing and very essential.
